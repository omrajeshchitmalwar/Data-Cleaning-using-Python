# 📊 Data Cleaning using Python

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd8f8e9b-7d93-473b-9795-a6f725778a75)


This project involves cleaning and preprocessing a dataset using Python. The aim is to transform raw data into a clean dataset that is ready for analysis. The process includes handling missing values, correcting data types, removing duplicates, and normalizing data.

## 🛠️ Data Analysis Steps
### 📦 Import Libraries:
- pandas: Used for data manipulation, reading CSV files, creating DataFrames, handling missing values, etc.
- numpy: Used for numerical operations, handling missing data, and array manipulation.
- datetime: Used for handling date and time data types.
- re: Used for regular expressions to clean text data.
- matplotlib.pyplot: Used for creating various plots and visualizations like histograms and bar charts.
### 🧹 Data Collection and Cleaning:
- Load the dataset from a CSV file.
- Check for missing values and handle them by filling or removing.
- Convert data types to appropriate formats (e.g., datetime, numeric).
- Remove duplicate records.
- Correct inconsistencies in categorical data (e.g., standardizing country names).
- Normalize data for consistent formatting (e.g., phone numbers, email addresses).
### 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Visualize the distribution of numerical and categorical features to identify trends and patterns.
- Analyze the frequency and distribution of missing values.
- Create summary statistics to understand the dataset.
### 📈 Data Cleaning Techniques:
- Impute missing values using mean, median, or mode for numerical data.
- Fill missing categorical data with the most frequent value or a placeholder.
- Standardize date formats and extract relevant components (e.g., year, month, day).
- Use regular expressions to clean and format text data (e.g., phone numbers, email addresses).
- Remove or replace outliers in numerical data.
### 📊 Visualization:
- Plot histograms and bar charts to visualize the distribution of cleaned data.
- Create box plots to identify and handle outliers.
- Visualize correlations between numerical features to understand relationships.
